## About the Internship
The SQL internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS provided an opportunity to explore and apply advanced SQL concepts.

## Tasks Performed
### 1. **Hotel Booking System**
I designed a comprehensive database for managing hotel bookings, including entities like rooms, customers, reservations, and payments. Key tasks included:
- Creating relational tables with constraints to ensure data integrity.
- Writing SQL queries for inserting, updating, and retrieving booking data.
- Implementing complex queries to handle customer-specific requirements and payment processing.

### 2. **Library Management System**
This project focused on managing a library's book inventory, member details, and borrow/return transactions. The database was designed with the following:
- Tables for books, members, and transactions.
- Queries to add, update, and delete records efficiently.
- Reports to track overdue books and borrower histories.

### 3. **Joins and Data Integration**
To combine data across multiple tables, I practiced using various SQL joins, including:
- **INNER JOIN:** To fetch related records between tables.
- **LEFT JOIN:** For including unmatched rows from one table.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** To ensure rows from the second table were included.
- **FULL JOIN:** For combining all matching and non-matching rows.

### 4. **Advanced SQL Techniques**
Utilized advanced SQL features to analyze data effectively:
- **Window Functions:** For calculating running totals and rankings.
- **Subqueries and CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** For modular and reusable query structures.

### 5. **Database Migration**
Performed a database migration between SQL and PostgreSQL. Key highlights:
- Ensured data integrity during the migration process.
- Wrote scripts to automate data transformation and loading.

### 6. **Backup and Recovery**
Demonstrated database backup and recovery using SQL queries. Tasks included:
- Automating regular backups using SQL scripts.
- Testing restoration procedures to verify data recovery.
